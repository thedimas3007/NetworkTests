### Building a Jar

`gradlew jar` / `./gradlew jar`

Output jar should be in `build/libs`.

### Submodules

- `core` is the core server and client
- `packets` some extra packets and utils that can be used in developments
- `test` only for internal use

### TODO

- [ ] Review, clean and improve code structure
- [ ] Review JavaDoc
- [ ] More useful methods


#### Server
- [ ] Requests

#### Client
- [ ] `EventListener` like in server
- [ ] `response` for requests
